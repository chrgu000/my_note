#### Rihanna, breaking new ground, joins with LVMH for fashion brand

```
On Friday, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury group, officially confirmed not only that the fashion line created by Rihanna was becoming part of its gilded stable but also that the first products from the new company would be unveiled — in a few weeks.
Rihanna will become the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison, and her line will be the first new house created by the group since Christian Lacroix in 1987. It joins such storied heritage brands as Dior, Givenchy, Celine and Fendi and positions Rihanna as a breakthrough designer on a number of levels.
The Group resources are notably large — LVMH reported first-quarter revenue in April of 12.5 billion euros ($14.1 billion), an increase of 16% — and the emphasis on “multicultural, ” in a time when many luxury brands are suffering from charges of cultural insensitivity and discrimination, is significant.
LVMH has been making strides in recent years to right the gender balance in luxury, appointing the first female designers of Givenchy in 2017 and Dior in 2016.
Fenty, however, has made inclusivity of all kinds — size, race, gender identity — part of its identity from the beginning.
